#3 types of ml -> Superwised, unsuperwised , reinforcement
#superwised - data has input+output so task is to predict like regression-  nums, classification- categories
#unsuperwised - data only has inputs no proper outputs eg: customer segmentation
#reinforcement -  agent learn by reward or punishments

#process - import -> clean and preprocess -> split in train and validation -> choosing ml models -> train model -> evaluation testing random -> deploy

#basic common models -> linear reg , random forest, decision tree, logisitnc reg, neural netwoeks, k nearest neigh, kmeans clustering

#linear regression -> model predits only nums , line best fitts data like sales 
#logistic regression -> model that predicts yes/no ->classifiction like spam or not -> deals with 1/0
#decision tree -> model that takes decision based on if else rules ..simple use cases..expalins how decisions are made..decisding if person will get loan based on sal etc
#random forest -> group of many decision trees working together..use case is to get more accurate results and reduce errors..eg : predicting weather student will pass or fail
#navy bia -> probabiltiy based to features are independed..
#k nearesr -> looks at closest data pts to decide ans...simple pattern recognnition...groupin people with same movie taste
#k means -> grps data into clusters based on similarity...to find hidden patterns in unlabelled data -> unsuperwised learning..eg grooupung customers with similar shopping behaviour
#neural networks -> set of layers that learn complex patterns like human brain..used for dl ...like face recog
#..many more like yolo etc adv models exist

#Features -> input Labels -> output

#Overfitting- model momorizes and underfitting-model learns nothing...hence we must balence both
